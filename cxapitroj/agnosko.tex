I thank the people and organizations
that directly or indirectly provided me with
their mathematical assistance,
without which
\href{https://github.com/septsea/det}{this book}
would have no foundation.

I thank soft music,
to which I often listen for relieving stress and anxiety;
I thank Esperanto,
which I like to use to name files;
I thank \LaTeX{},
by which I am able to write mathematical formulae rapidly;
I thank Visual Studio Code,
which is a modern and gook-looking editor;
I thank the Vim emulator,
with which I work much more efficiently;
I thank Windows 11 Pro for Workstations Insider Preview
(in the Canary Channel),
which is a

operating system.

It is true that I have spent much money and time on the project:
I need money to advertise
\href{https://github.com/septsea/det}{this book};
I need time to proofread
\href{https://github.com/septsea/det}{this book}.
Hence, I also thank my money and time.

Finally, never will I forget to thank my

{By "wives,"
    I mean fictional female characters
    from non-live-action visual media
    to whom I am romantically attracted.},
whom I have not met yet.
Hardly would I have the stimulus actually to write
\href{https://github.com/septsea/det}{this book}
without them.
